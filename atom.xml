<p>The new Texan SB 8 abortion law was halted by a federal judge after the Department of Justice sued Texas for its unconstitutional accusations and the impact brought by the new law, which caused massive shutdown of the abortion clinics due to their consternations of being sued. The SB 8 abortion law stated the prohibition to abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy, even from unintentional means like rape, sexual abuse, incest etc. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman said that &quot;women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution&quot; after the law has went into effect last month. He also stated that &quot;......This Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right&quot;. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland commented on court's decision as &quot;a victory for women in Texas and for the rule of law&quot;, and claims that &quot;it is the foremost responsibility of the Department of Justice to defend the Constitution&quot;.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>这几日发生在中原大地上的人间惨剧，相信各位都有目共睹。</p>
<p>如果各位读者点进了这篇文章，站长恳请你抽出一分钟的时间，为现在在河南的每一位正在受苦的人祈福，也希望为每一位不幸逝世的人默哀。</p>
<p>站长在洪水爆发的前夕到访过河南，并被那里雄厚的历史以及热情友好的本地人打动。</p>
<p>现在，我们在这片土地上见到了失去至亲的悲痛，<strong>也有在一个个人之中展现的舍小我为大义的勇气。</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>这些人的精神堪比钻石，他们的光辉将比肩繁星。</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p>站长本来计划从河南回来时更新博文，讲一下自己的游记。</p>
<p>但我刚刚离开的时候暴雨就开始倾入，并造成了一系列惨剧。</p>
<p>看到了许许多多惨痛的后果之后，以及加上站长本人的一点不勤快，<strong>站长觉得在发生灾难之时更新游记不是非常妥当，所以决定将河南游记无限期延更，直至灾情过去之时。</strong></p>
<p>河南是一个美妙的地方，五天的游览给站长带来了很多美好的回忆。只希望灾情能够尽快过去，我们在那时候也能一起分享河南之行的喜悦。</p>
<hr>
<p>在最后，站长想给各位分享一首歌曲，歌名叫Come Healing，歌手名为Elayna Boynton，下图为专辑封面：</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/WcX5ee"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/25/WcX5ee.jpg" alt="WcX5ee.jpg" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p>这首歌曲曾被用为王子逸导演的电影《别告诉她》的主题曲，电影讲述了一个亲情的故事，有兴趣的读者可以自行寻找观看。</p>
<p>这首歌里面站长最喜欢的是它的音调，以及它的歌词，十分建议看着歌词一起听。</p>
<p>希望这首歌，不论被谁听到，也不论你在不在灾区中央，都能给你带来抚摸，使你的心灵重归平静。</p>
<p>愿天佑河南，以及每一位受苦受难的人。</p>
<p>也感谢所有对河南表示支持及关切的个人，企业，以及外国政府。</p>
<p>最重要的，<strong>感谢每一位在救援中奉献了自己力量的人。</strong></p>
<p>阿门🙏🙏🙏🕯🕯🕯</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今日节气正值大暑，在看了看天气，知道了现在整个广州都是个大空气炸锅的事实之后，站长我就突然决定出门转转，安放心情。</p>
<p>在长寿东路坚记面店一顿完美的牛腩捞伊面，以及一个看起来不会下雨偷袭我这个老同志的天气，让我产生了这将会是完美的一天的暂时性错觉。</p>
<p>坐车抵达了珠江新城，并横跨了海心桥走过了广州塔然后又转回来最后坐在公园长椅上休息的天真的我，还没有意识到生活给我精心设计了一场荒诞戏剧。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://gitee.com/drclairvoyant/picgo-picbed/raw/master/IMG_20210722_154141.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>

<blockquote>
<p>桥上拍的，不知道为什么上个桥还要预约，你不就一给人走的桥吗</p>
</blockquote>
<p>当我已经歇息足够，起身出发找点喝的并已经走到商场门口时，我把手往裤兜里一摸，结果空空如也～</p>
<p>在我的大脑短暂空白了一两秒后，我才意识到<strong>我的口罩竟然丢了！！！</strong></p>
<p>悲剧了，流泪了，此时我站在暖风中一阵凌乱。</p>
<p>处在一个被各种钢铁高楼CBD围绕的城市中心，渺小的我竟然感受到了一种如同在大街上裸奔的无地自容。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/WcTYjJ"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/24/WcTYjJ.png" alt="WcTYjJ.png" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>跟老白差不多</p>
</blockquote>
<p>在意识到了这个残酷的现实过后，站长秉承着“人总不至于站着饿死”的精神，去到旁边寻找可能的免费口罩。</p>
<p>既然身处在珠江新城–––广州的市中心，这么先进繁华的地方，又离广州塔这个大景点这么近，总不至于连一个口罩都没有吧？</p>
<p>毕竟离广州塔这么近，基本上等于这里会是游客常来的地方，而这些地方都会有提供服务的游客中心。果不其然，走几步路就碰上了党群服务中心，而且有四个，于是站长遂逐个进入要口罩……</p>
<p>结果四个里面一个都没有。</p>
<p>那时我甚至有些怀疑我是不是某种地球无性繁殖出来的某种生物，连点地球妈妈的爱都享受不到，只觉得往脸上吹的暖风更劲了些。</p>
<p>四个党群服务中心兼游客中心，急救包你容得下，AED你容得下，墙上满满的党史你也容得下，但怎么就容不下一个小小的口罩呢？</p>
<p>站长当时一时不知道如何是好，因为即使没带口罩进不去商场，你连公交车和地铁都上不去！</p>
<p>似乎唯一的出路就只能是招个的士打道回府，正当我准备承认口罩这小伙子不跟我这老同志讲武德的时候，我的眼神突然转向了一个方向，一间便利店。</p>
<p>便利店！对啊，即使游客服务中心碰巧没有，但是便利店基本上都有口罩的啊！</p>
<p>于是我走近店面，<strong>摆在货架上的口罩和温和的售货员大妈正在对我闪耀着爱的光辉。</strong></p>
<p>买了口罩并戴上了之后，我想出了一句话：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>健康码是衣服，而口罩则是我们的内裤。</p>
<p>––– 站长</p>
</blockquote>
<p>不过美中不足的是，卖的口罩没有分装只有合装，就是五六个口罩装在了一起的那种，但是也至少总比没有好。</p>
<p>走在街上，脸上带着一个口罩，手里又拿着一包口罩，感觉像是战场被一颗子弹打中之后，而对火力不足产生了恐惧。</p>
<p>就好比可能别人都只拿一把步枪踏上战场，而我则是双持了两个重型机枪。</p>
<hr>
<p>解决完晚饭，夜色降临大地，站长也在回程的公交车思考了一番。</p>
<p>虽然现在我们人人都已经养成了出门做好充足防疫要求的习惯，但是即使在大多数人养成了习惯的同时，我们也需要考虑到多个应急预案和小概率情况。</p>
<p>就像即使一栋大楼里边人人都不会去玩火，可都还是要备好灭火器和消防水管一样。</p>
<p>这次虽然在四个党群服务中心都没有拿到口罩，但是有一说一，每一个都配备了AED和急救物品，这个也是值得表扬的。</p>
<p>只不过，站长在这里也由衷的希望，情况也可以考虑的更加全面一点点。就像大多数人不会丢口罩，我们大多数时候也可能碰不到别人心脏骤停需要我们急救的情况，但是我们也都需要配备好如AED的所有的应对措施。</p>
<p>那这里AED有了，口罩是不是也可以考虑一下呢？</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>有些人可能看到这个博客会感到有些奇怪，不是说是叫「Micah的日常BB Channel」吗？那你这网址域名里的「drclairvoyant」又是什么意思？</p>
<p>其实Micah是我自己平常使用的一个英语名，是《圣经》里面一位先知的名字。这个名字是我的一位小学校长给我起的，而Dr_Clairvoyant其实是我另外一个虚拟名称（既是网名也是笔名）。</p>
<p>用了clairvoyant这个词是我一开始看了神盾局特工第一季的时候有一个反派好像叫「千里眼」，英语名就叫clairvoyant，当时觉得这个单词逼格过高于是就作为己用了。我也有想过把这个单词中译，单纯中译的话就叫「千里眼」，但我个人觉得不太好听，于是就想了「老千」这个名字。</p>
<p><s>当然这个和作弊出猫的那个老千不是一个东西啊</s></p>
<p>那有些聪明帅气的读者可能就问了说「啊那这样的话你为什么不叫“老千的日常BB Channel”啊？」，我一开始也纠结过这个问题，后面决定用Micah是因为这个名字对我来说也更亲近一点，而且也没有老千这个词本身带有的歧义😋</p>
<p>不过在这里你们用上面的任何一个名字呼叫本站长也没有任何问题！</p>

想对索尼发布会与七七事变“撞车”说几句，其实绝大多数人的反感估计都是觉得索尼专挑这一天来开发布会，是“有意的碰瓷”，觉得日本人不和我们在这一天痛哭流涕是一种罪过，但如果就只是开了个发布会跟日期刚好装上你都还要抵制日货，那你这心理承受能力也太差了。</p>
<p>我们作为新一代，国耻自然是不能忘记，但同时也应该具有良好的文化自信能力。这种自信能力不是体验在穿着中华传统服饰上街不顾旁人的眼光就完事的了，而是在纪念其他民族对自身民族造成的苦难时保持良好平和的态度严肃正视历史问题。谁说遇到这种事的时候就一定要以得了甲亢一般的怒气相待了？</p>
<p>要是以纯粹的愤怒来应对，并同时指责别人为什么不跟其他愤怒的人一样愤怒的话，恐怕会有更多的人，脑袋被U型锁砸破，然后落得一身残疾。</p>
<p>再给一些真的不想作深度思考的人写点小拓展：上面说的“良好平和的态度”不是要你把对方当爷，像宠着贵妃一样好生伺候，而是在即使对方是以前的敌国的时候也能保持基本的礼数和尊敬。这种概念可能有些人会说“我们为什么要和一个以前的敌人友好”？如果这么想的话再想想为什么现在的中国与日本建交了，而且两国之间还有政府出资的文化交流？你也可以把事情做绝，现在就跑去日本驻华大使馆抽日本驻华大使一耳光，但是之后的结果你可得考虑清楚，万一真因为你的一耳光日本人决定和中国断交了也不是完全不可能的事。</p>
<p>我们要抵制的是这种法西斯军国主义以及以前对平民百姓下手的侩子手，而不是现在与以前的历史罪行毫无瓜葛的平民以及无辜的商品（有些商品虽然说是日本品牌，可也都还是中国生产，你坑的最直接的可能都是我们工人同胞），你要是一个日本人，看见一个中国人骂你罪恶多端，用上了各种粗口脏话，而他骂你的原因却都是一些你出生之前的事，你内心还会想和这个人或者是这个民族保持良好的关系吗？</p>
<p>以前二战的时候，德国纳粹党的威力震慑全欧洲，然后到最后也落得一个战败的下场。美国、苏联和欧洲多个国家都参与了战争，也没见他们之后对改组之后的德国政府和大使拳打脚踢。不过一战战后的时候英国、法国和意大利（这三国家里两个是协约国，跟德国打仗也被打得重）都也怀揣着“为什么不严厉惩戒德国”的小九九对战后的德国拳打脚踢，于是踢着踢着就踢了个二战出来（希特勒就是靠着极端的民族主义上台的）。</p>
<p>个人拙见而已，各位若感无趣，一笑划走便是🙏🙏🙏</p>
<p>（后面才想起来，要是把索尼赶走了，你们手机的相机cmos怎么办？倒是可以用三星，但是之前你们也不是一个个骂“高丽棒子”骂得挺凶的吗？）</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="我决定去学日语了">我决定去学日语了</h1>
<p>首先，先庆贺一下我的博客正式开通啦！</p>
<p>开站的第一篇正经文章，我也没有太多灵感，于是就想拿这件事来说道说道。</p>
<p>日语这个东西，我一直觉得这玩意儿在中国的普及率可能比英语还要高。</p>
<p>就比如在学校里，你可能不会说英语，但是大多数动漫的名场面或者名台词你都能用日语招呼的上来。</p>
<p>但与此同时，这也成为了我对一开始学习日语有些抗拒的原因。</p>
<p>因为一听到日语，我本人就老是会将它关联到二次元，而本人又对二次元又不是特别感冒（觉得有时候真的太中二了），所以即使我喜欢学习外来语，也对学习日语也不是那么有兴趣了。</p>
<p><strong>但是这里别误会，每个人想成为什么样的人都是依照着他们的自由意志，我个人并不能对其干涉；而且我遇到的有些人同样也是二次元爱好者，但是也是一群可爱的人😊</strong></p>
<h2 id="学日语之前">学日语之前</h2>
<p>在学日语之前，我其实对韩语比较感兴趣。</p>
<p>韩语吸引我的原因并不是因为其背后的文化，<strong>而是因为其简单的字形，以及（我个人觉得）更加官方的一种风格。</strong></p>
<p>拿字形来说，日语有分平假名和片假名两个类别，两个类别的书写也不尽相同；之前有一位可爱的同学试过教我日语，但是因为我怎么也写不好平假名，所以他就血压极速升高然后就放弃了（在这里再跟这位同学说声对不起🙏🙏🙏）</p>
<p>而韩语呢，字不是横竖就是方块圆圈，没有日语的那么多拐弯；而且韩语的字符也是靠辅音和元音组合来发生，在刚开始学的时候其实会比日语直接背哪个字发哪个音简单一些（不过到后面读的时候日语会简单一些，因为一个字只发一个音，韩语的话你还要先过一遍脑子想想这个是怎么组合怎么读的）。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/28/rCi2bE49fpHvPVU.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>我妈自己也不止一次的对我表示了我学韩语的不满，她自己更倾向于我去日本留学而不是去韩国，而且他觉得我的性格和日本人很像：谦和有礼并且守规矩；与此同时我的那个同学（教我日语未果然后血压升高那个）也在我学韩语这方面对我有些鄙视了👎</p>
<p>但是这些因素我自己也没有太过理会，因为情况也还没严重到我不学日语就要很讨厌我的一种程度😅</p>
<h2 id="为什么去学了日语">为什么去学了日语？</h2>
<p>直到差不多期末的时候，事态就开始变化了……</p>
<p>我认识了一个美术界的大牛，自己跟着他做个小徒弟，期末之前的时候他刚好来深圳，我们就一起聚了个餐（我妈当时也在场）。聚餐的时候，他问起我的近况，我妈就跟他说我学什么不好非要学韩语，然后他就跟我说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>你要这么说的话，那我也要跟着鄙视你了。</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>其实除开这个还有一些其他的因素，例如韩国人的平均素质和当时韩国因为和我们这双边文化关系不合而产生的种种矛盾，但是这里就不会对这些东西详细讲了，毕竟这个问题也不是我这一个人能讲得清的，而且当时我的脑子里就一件事情：</p>
<p><strong>这可是我师傅啊！要是只有我妈鄙视我那还算家事倒还说得过去，但是要我师傅也开始了那就问题大了！！！</strong></p>
<p>作为徒弟的我丝毫不敢怠慢，于是在期末结束之后我马上开了一个多邻国的日语课程，并一直坚持打卡至今。</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/28/QVXNThWSwiogJ15.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/06/28/m1q6BC9u7NJT5QW.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>我也同时的把这件事告诉了我的那个教我日语的同学，一把结果告诉他后他马上开始手舞足蹈的幸灾乐祸。</p>
<h2 id="现在感想如何">现在感想如何？</h2>
<p>现在，<strong>真香。</strong></p>
<p>在之前的段落就提过，韩语的字符虽然能学得快，但是一开始读的时候很可能会断断续续、不顺畅，而日语一字一音的设计虽然前期学习成本有些高（就只能背），但是后面读的时候就能很顺畅的读出来。</p>
<p>至少现在的一些名台词和日语歌词也能慢慢的读出来了，比如说ここすき（喜欢这个部分）、あいしてる（朋友情侣之间说的喜欢你）、ここだよ（ko ko da yo！感觉可以直接理解为闪亮登场的意思，就是有点点中二）、甚至是『いいよ、こいよ！』<strong>（这句いいよ、こいよ！是个梗，最好别去查什么意思……）</strong></p>
<p>不过在学习日语的同时，我倒也没有放下与韩语的一些接触，而这些接触方法也主要是<strong>看韩剧</strong>。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>我看的韩剧《窥探》，这里对学校某位法语老师开的韩语社表示谢意</p>
</blockquote>
<p>倒是我妈恨不得让我和韩语藕断且丝不连，每次看完韩剧的时候她就向我表示她听里面的对白都快要疯了💦……</p>
<p>哦对了，除开韩剧，我现在也入了JoJo的坑了👍</p>

<h2 id="现在水平如何">现在水平如何？</h2>
<p>我目前平假名的50音就快学完了，还没有学到如何造句，但是多邻国的课程已经有带有形容词的名词的题目了。</p>
<p>以后还会努力学习，如果能超过以前尝试过教我日语的同学就感觉更好了😋</p>
<p>之前我还去过一次日本，当时仅靠英语和手语和我妈和外婆在各个城市活了下来，现在想想能做到这件事也是挺不可思议的（英语在日本的普及率感觉并不是很高）……</p>
<p>如果以后有机会，我挺想在学好日语之后再去一次日本，切切实实的感受当地浓厚的风情文化。</p>
<p>以后能不能去日本目前还是一个未知数，<strong>但希望这次学日语的开始也能成为这段缘的开始。</strong></p>
